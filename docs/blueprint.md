## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Soft blue (#89B5F7) to evoke a sense of calm and trustworthiness.
- Background color: Light grayish-blue (#F0F4F8), very close in hue to the primary color, for a calm and uncluttered background.
- Accent color: Muted violet (#A089F7) for interactive elements, providing contrast while remaining within a calming palette.
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans', a humanist sans-serif that combines a modern look with approachability and a bit of warmth.
- Use simple, clean icons from a set like Feather or Phosphor, with rounded corners, using the accent color (#A089F7).
- Implement a mobile-first, responsive layout with ample whitespace to reduce visual clutter.
- Use subtle transitions and animations for form elements and button hover states to enhance the user experience without being distracting.
